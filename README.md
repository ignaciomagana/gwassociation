A comprehensive Python framework for evaluating associations between gravitational wave (GW) events and electromagnetic (EM) transients using Bayesian statistics.

## Features

- **Bayesian Association Analysis**: Compute posterior odds for GW-EM associations
- **Multiple Overlap Integrals**: Spatial (I_Ω), distance (I_DL), and temporal (I_t)
- **EM Models**: Support for kilonova, GRB, and afterglow models
- **Candidate Ranking**: Rank multiple EM candidates by association probability
- **Publication-Quality Plots**: Generate figures for papers and presentations
- **Command-Line Interface**: Easy-to-use CLI for quick analysis

## Installation

### Basic Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

### Full Installation (with optional dependencies)
```bash
pip install -e ".[full]"
```

### For LIGO members (with proprietary tools)
```bash
pip install -e ".[ligo]"
```

## Quick Start

### Command Line
```bash
gw-assoc --gw-file skymap.fits --ra 120.5 --dec -30.0 --z 0.05 --time 1234567890
```

### Python API
```python
from gw_assoc import Association

# Create association
assoc = Association("skymap.fits", {
    "ra": 120.5,
    "dec": -30.0,
    "z": 0.05,
    "time": 1234567890
})

# Compute odds
results = assoc.compute_odds()
print(f"P(Associated) = {results['confidence']:.1%}")
```

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify installation:
```bash
python test_gw_assoc.py
```

For minimal testing (no optional dependencies):
```bash
python test_gw_assoc.py --minimal
```

## Documentation

See the `examples.py` script for detailed usage examples:
```bash
python examples.py
```

## Methods

This framework implements state-of-the-art statistical methods based on:
- Ashton et al. (2018, 2021) - Bayesian framework for GW-EM associations
- Singer & Price (2016) - Rapid sky localization with BAYESTAR
- Recent O4 papers on GW follow-up strategies

### Association Statistics

The posterior odds for association are calculated as:
```
O_posterior = O_prior × BF
BF = (I_Ω × I_DL × I_t) / P_chance
```

Where:
- I_Ω: Spatial overlap integral
- I_DL: Distance overlap integral  
- I_t: Temporal overlap integral
- P_chance: Chance coincidence probability

## Requirements

### Required
- Python ≥ 3.7
- numpy, scipy, astropy, matplotlib

### Recommended
- healpy (for HEALPix sky maps)
- pandas (for data handling)
- seaborn (for enhanced plots)

### Optional
- ligo.skymap (for advanced GW sky map handling)
- ligo-gracedb (for GraceDB access)
